**Art Gallery Management Project (DBMS)**

This database management project involves three key tables: Artist, Artwork, and Customers. The system is designed to track which artworks have been purchased by specific customers. It also allows for seamless data management, enabling the insertion of new records and giving artists the flexibility to remove their artworks if desired.
